# Restful

This is a small package for working with HTTP input data in PHP. When a POST request comes into PHP, the Content-Type and Content-Body (Raw input) of the request are handled and parsed into the _POST/_FILES arrays. This package parses the raw input body for all RESTful verbs (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) into the _REQUEST/_FILES arrays and provides a better way for working with uploaded files.
